## The project directory structure
â€‹
The project is compiled for Node Package Manager and follows the standard directory structure used in most Cypress projects implementing custom commands, DRY and KISS patterns:
```Gherkin
src
  + cypress                               | Location of automation source files                               
    + e2e                                 | Contains all the tests 
    + fixtures                            | .json files to store all isolated data required to execute the tests 
    + support                             | Contains elements, commands and  
        + commands                        | Custom commands that simulate the user interactions                      
        + elements                        | Defined constants that include the DOM locators
        + utilities.js                    | Common functions 
        + e2e.js                          | Class to import all created commands
+ cypress.config.js                       | Global Cyopress configuration. The most important variable here is the baseUrl
+ package.json                            | Node package manager
